## a. Baseline
Draft an ISMS scope for home network and study lab that is half to 1 page long which describes
1. What is included

2. What is excluded and why

The target environment is your own home network, where you are doing course exercises. The “organization” is, in practice, your own household plus your own IT environment (devices, router/Wi-Fi, cloud services, lab machines, possible NAS, etc.).

Goal: define a sensible ISMS scope, identify interfaces, and produce documentation that could, in principle, be auditable (on paper).

a) Baseline
Task: Draft the ISMS scope for your home network and study lab (½–1 page). Describe at minimum:

1. What is included in scope
Home network basic infrastructure: router, Wi-Fi, any shared folders/NAS, printer, IoT (if relevant).

Devices used for course exercises: laptop/workstation, any virtual machines, practice server (e.g., Linux VM), phone (if you use MFA).

Information: course materials, your own notes, repositories, lab datasets, and any accounts/credentials/keys.

 
2. What you exclude and why
Examples of exclusions: other family members’ devices, smart TV, game console, employer-managed machine, the ISP’s network “on the internet side.”

Justify exclusions: ownership, controllability, irrelevance from the course perspective, and risk acceptance.

 
3. Key interfaces
Cloud services (e.g., GitHub/GitLab, Google Drive/OneDrive, the study LMS).

Remote access (VPN, SSH, RDP), the boundary between the home network and the internet (router, firewall).

Suppliers: ISP (operator), device vendor, cloud service provider.

Deliverables (submission):

Scope text (½–1 page)

One simple network and interface diagram (boxes + arrows is sufficient) showing:

“Home network/lab” area (in-scope)

“Outside” (out-of-scope)

interfaces (internet/cloud/remote access)

Evidence add-on (1–3 lines per item):

At the end, write: “What evidence could I present?”
(e.g., a screenshot of the router settings page, device list, VM listing, repo link, backup settings).

 
b) Tie It to the Standard
Task: Identify at least 2 interested parties in a home network context, and for each write:

need/expectation/requirement (security/privacy/availability, etc.)

which ISO 27001 requirement area it links to (context / leadership / planning / operation / performance evaluation / improvement)

How would you demonstrate fulfillment (evidence)

Example interested parties (choose those relevant to you):

You – continuity of exercises, data retention

Family members/roommates – privacy, the lab not disrupting daily life

Internet service provider – contract terms, device usage terms

Cloud services (GitHub, Google, Microsoft) – account security, MFA, compliance with terms

Educational institution/course organizer – academic integrity, no harmful activity on the network

Potential employer (if you use the same machine/network) – segregation, protection of information

Authority/regulation (general level) – personal data processing, lawful use
