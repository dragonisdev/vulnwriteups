## a. Wifi Challenge lab 2.1
This is a virtual machine that simulates a wireless access point which you need to attack. Basically you are hosting a simulated wireless local area network on your laptop and you need to use Kali to scan and attack it.

### Installation
In the installation I already ran into issues because the walkthrough did not include installation guide, and I ran into an issue where Virtual Box gave me an error because of an Audio Adapter.

First we download the OVA file from the proton folder: https://drive.proton.me/urls/Q4WPB23W7R#Qk4nxMH8Q4oQ

Then we get it and we must extract it into a OVF file to import easier using `tar xvf filename.ovf` 

But we still get the error. We must actually open notepad and edit the `<AudioAdapter>` and just completely remove it after that you can add it to Virtual Box with no issues.

### Step 1.

## c. What are my thoughts
